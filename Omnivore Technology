Nanobot 
 
  Nanobot capable of replicating organic material. It's "mother" processor is somewhere outside.  
 
 
  Nanobot power:  
 
  Omni's nanobots are powered wirelessly using alternating current. The generator is a bit cyclic; it needs an initial spark and then it can generate some amount of energy by itself. It can be charged through user's body. If you exercise, you can charge it too!  
 
  Some choose to keep nanobot inactive, even removed out of body because it does feed off of you, and especially if you are going to rest for a long time, it is very good idea to turn it off. 
 
  Leonhard may need this initial spark because he had it off the whole time. Therefore, he initially would not be able to regenerate any part of his body. 
  
 
 
Nanobot: Regen technology 
 
Omni's regeneration technology increases speed of cell duplication. How this is achieved, it is not known to human. Omnivores have natural ability to regenerate, similar to that of Earth's salamanders. However, the new cell is not the same as previous one. Because of this, Omnis each have preferred area of "bite", and will normally dedicate that area for being consumed while protecting the other areas. 
 
This technology CAN be used on human being. The nanobot technology which acts as "stimulator" for rapid growth can be inserted into human blood to do the same thing.  
 
 
Nanobot: Regen technology - on human 
Interestingly, this technology works BETTER on human due to high-mineral-blood[salty, like ocean] and because it rapidly circulates and pumps through the body.  
I think it is interesting to think about how one would even transfer it. Since it runs in your blood, once the nanobot gets into your body, you are forever identified by Omni that owns the nanobot. You kind of gets an "owner".

Mother Vetic 
 
This is a security setup in the planet to prevent Walkers from going on murder rampage for fun. Since the living creatures are part of intricate part of the system, you are not allowed to kill information that is part of the system. You must wait for the creature to be "out of loop", it means it has became trash information. Despite Vetic's complexity, it has never figured out a way to clean this out on its own. Because Vetic is so complex, it has an ability to "heal". It means you CAN get away with killing a couple, but doing it too much you become marked, and punishment does occur. It is similar to putting "down vote" on you, and if it is too high, you get kicked out.
