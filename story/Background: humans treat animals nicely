This is a pattern Omnivore figures out early on. Humans are USUALLY [not all the time] nice to animals, especially farm kids. They learn that animals are innocent early on, so they usually do not harm them back either. 

Omnivore uses this to their adventage, not to infiltrate human's life, but for their own safety when they need help. Young Omnivores do not grow in significant size until they are mature. This means, young Omnivores look small, and like harmless creature to human. Because of this, some young omnivores actually choose to be as vulnerable as possible when near another human, and refuse to display any sign of inteligence.

I wonder if this story can somehow start with one of the omnivore in captivity as a "pet", where the human assume they do not hold any inteligence... [I initially did this with Kiefer. can I afford another one?]
