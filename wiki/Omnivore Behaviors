In Omnivore's world, "cannibalism" plays a somewhat vital role.  
 
Similar to ants and birds sharing food from crop, Omnivores share food with others mouth-to-mouth. "Mouth", while intimate, it doesn't exactly carry some kind of sexual message to Omnis. Action such as kissing is seen as a very casual activity.  
 
 
Organ dedicated to sharing 
 
Omnis have organ dedicated just to give it to someone else. The organ deposits nutrition over a course of time and once "full" it can be taken out to feed. The deposits are made slowly overtime taking out what is "left over" from the body. Different form waste! 
 
 
Traditional Cannibalism [and rise of regen. technology] 
 
Actual tranditional cannibalism does occur, but this occur in small amount. Gluttony is seen as great sin among Omnis as taking more than you need actually hurt another.  
 
As natural part of their nature, Omnis have ways to defend themselves from pain, and this is why in a GROUP, the main signal is sent a little differently and it is perceived as pleasure instead of pain.  
 
Regeneration is very energy demanding. To restore bodily order, Omnivores are known to take very long sleep [3-4 earth days], and also takes hibernation that is not season-based, but in rhythm of rest of the brood. Similar to budgies taking nap when the entire group decides to do so.  
 
Regeneration's lack of speed have prevented Omnis from growing in number rapidly, but higher number of population meant domination over other countries. In order to increase speed of regeneration, Omnis have always poured all their knowledge and time on developing medical technology. Omnis' medical science is extremely advanced.

Omnivors receptivity of light and their ability to communicate is very well linked, since they communicate in sequence of light flashes. The flashes of "light" is not fully visible to human eye, making it extremely difficult, if not, impossible to "See" what they are saying with bare eyes. 

[problem: energy to generate light could be quite daunting and unrealistic for communication. Another problem is the limitation of how light travels. It can go far, but it doesn't quite spread.]

[Another problem: this seem a little too advenced for a biological being to begin with. Sound is VERY mechanical, while light isn't. I can turn light into a mechanical way of communicating by allowing Omnivores to contract their muscles to vary their light emission. Kind of like how LED lights work I suppose]
